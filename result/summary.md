The purpose of this repository is to develop a model which correctly identifies cancerous skin lesions.
In 2022, approximately 331,722 new cases of melanoma were diagnosed worldwide, wcrf.org.
Melenoma and Skin Cancers account around 60,000 deaths per year according to Skin Cancer Statistics wcrf.org.
In Denmark Melenoma is the 5th most comman cancer who.org.

Going to the images we have seen I saw the hair removal algorithm struggle more specifically with white/grey haired images classified as hairy.
output_img_0713, output_img_0642 & output_img_0686 are good examples of this.

Moving forward it was best to adjust and develop dhigher contrast in the image such that these hairs could be removed.
